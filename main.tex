\section*{Original Aims of the Project}
There were two aims for this project. The first was to write a library allowing programmers to use \textit{Monte Carlo Tree Search} (\textit{MCTS}) in the context of game playing in \textit{artificial intelligence} (\textit{AI}). The second was to determine if the success achieved by MCTS at playing \textit{Go} could be translated into the \textit{Connect} family of games.

\section*{Work Completed}
Over the course of this project, a versatile MCTS library has been constructed. The library can be used to implement game playing \textit{agents} for a large range of games, from single player puzzles to $n$ player, imperfect information, non zero-sum games with simultaneous play. The library is fully documented and supports the implementation of many of the modifications to MCTS proposed in current research. This library is then used to make an agent which plays all games in the Connect family. This agent was able to beat a \textit{minimax} based agent in a 100 game \textit{Freestyle GoMoku} tournament.

\section*{Special Difficulties}
None.
